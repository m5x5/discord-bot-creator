# Bot Resources

Apart from the bot maker icon this folder contains two important building blocks of the builder.

## /actions

The actions folder contains outlines for all the actions that the bot can perform.
They are being used to generate the action buttons and fields in the builder.

## /bot

This folder contains all files that the bot needs to run.

### /bot/actions

In contrast to the previous action folder this folder contains the logic that is used to perform the actions on runtime.
